  'Michael Heredia Speaks for The Dead': `It’s 8 on a Friday night and I’m sitting in a Starbucks talking about death. Don’t worry. I’m fine.<br><br>Michael Heredia is sitting across from me, wearing a white button down, a black tie and a long black trench coat. Michael buried my grandfather, or Abuelo Augestine, in 1994. That’s when he met my family. He saw them all together again a little over a week ago. That’s when he buried my Abuelo Celedonio. <br><br>At my Abuelo’s wake my little sister’s mascara is dripping down my arm as she cries into my shoulder, whispering “We’re going to have to do this forever. We’re going to have to watch everyone we love die.” I pull her in closer and nudge towards my Abuela, whose head is against my Abuelo’s chest.<br><br>My Abuela turns to face Michael. “Are you going to take him away now?” He shakes his head. “Nope. We go when you want to.” She rests her cheek against my Abuelo’s silent heart for the last time, smiling. With shaking lips, my sister looks at Michael. “He must hate this…He has to watch everyone die.” I don’t think she realized that he was smiling too.<br><br>Holding a small coffee, Michael tells me how he knew my grandfather for years. They would see each other at Church every Sunday. My Abuelo and my Abuela would sit in the first pew. He saw them at everyone’s funeral too. “They were always together.” He pauses and taps his fingers against the counter. “That’s what really got me.”<br><br>For the online Obituary we had to make a selection of photos. There was one of my grandparents arm in arm, under an umbrella. “That one had me tearing up” Michael tells me.<br><br>“Who put the gangsta’ one in there?” He laughs, referring to a snapchat photo my cousin had included by accident. It was of my Abuelo smirking while throwing up the peace sign with large text reading “Ever since I knew I always wanted to be a gangsta.” “I thought that was great. That one had us cracking up.”<br><br>I remember the photo and look down at my tea, realizing my Abuelo will never be around for more photo ops. Mostly I wonder how Michael does it. A job that is guaranteed to be sad day in and day out. “It is difficult at times when I know people for years. But…I could mourn with everyone and be sad or I could show my sadness by helping. That is how I accompany you in your sorrow. Like the Spanish saying, te acompaño en tu sentimiento.”<br><br>I had never heard that phrase until my Abuelo died. Then I heard it all the time. Every time the doorbell to my Abuela’s house would ring. Every time I picked up the phone. Every time we ran into someone we hadn’t yet seen. I didn’t like it. It seemed off to me. Morbid and depressing.<br><br>I liked the way Michael had said it though. “This is how I accompany you in your sorrow. I’m here for you and this is how I’m here: to guide you, to help you, to wipe the tear out of your eye, hold your hand, and make sure that you get what you want and everything is taken care of so you don’t have a care in the world. You have so many other things going on.”<br><br>Michael did exactly that. He stood tall in the hallway of the wake, as my immediate family gathered to see my Abuelo for the last time. He took careful, slow steps forward, looking back the entire way, making sure everyone was as okay as they could be. He stood by my Abuela as he led her to the open casket. He left her alone when she needed, answered her questions when she asked. Held her hand when no one else did, smiled when she couldn’t do it herself. <br><br>“I feel like it’s a ministry. You are helping people at a very difficult time. People are lost, people need guidance. Some people are angry and you’re there and you’re helping them make sense of what’s going on. You’re there to help guide them the right way.”<br><br>Standing outside of the snowy church steps, I walk into the funeral mass with my two cousins and sister, holding flowers I had picked from the arrangements at the wake. <br><br>As I kick some snow beneath my feet, all I can think is how I hope Abuelo will like the white rose I picked out. The tears start, so I look back onto the busy street in Astoria, trying to focus on anything else. I see people with grocery bags. People walking their dogs. People wearing colors. People wearing black. Then I see Michael, directing everyone, stopping only after he sees my cousin, Joseph. He pulls aside my other two cousins, my boyfriend and my cousin’s fiancé, lining them all outside of the hearse.  <br><br>“I’m here to show you what you can do. Like the boys­…I saw the one that shares the birthday with your Abuelo. Joseph! I see him looking around and I knew he wanted to get in there. So I grab all the boys. These were your Abuelo’s guys! And I let them take him down the aisle. I wanted them to feel like they have a sense of belonging and that they helped, that they were part of his funeral.”<br><br>Outside of the church my boyfriend is crying. “I can’t believe they let me do that.” He was worried the language barrier for the past seven years meant my Abuelo didn’t know he cared.<br><br>Michael sees funerals as a beautiful tribute to people’s lives. It’s a duty that everyone has to do for their loved ones so they can have eternal repose and be on their way. “It’s something the family has to do for themselves too…so making everyone a part of it and wrapping it up together in a nice little bow is what I like to do.”<br><br>He warns me that not everyone is like my family. Sometimes you have people that didn’t like someone. “I get families that tell me hey no one could stand this guy and I says to them, he is what he is but you still have to bury him and give him what he deserved.”<br><br>A couple days after the funeral Michael is standing on my Abuela’s cement stoop, pointing to a window across the street. He tells my Aunt that the lady who lived there had passed away and was cremated. Her nephew was all that she had left and he refused to come pick up all that was left of her. “That saddens me…We have ashes from the 80s, the 70s…even the 60s! I call people up and I’m a pain in the ass but this is someone’s life here. I tortured this kid every week until he paid to have her put somewhere because I was tired of seeing her everyday in my funeral home. Now she has a place in the cemetery and every time I pass by, I give her a little wave.”<br><br>Funerals that don’t have anyone are even worse. A lot of times people have prearranged funerals and all their relatives have died already. “You know nothing about them and you try to piece it all together and give them what they wanted.” After an attorney told him that a woman had no family left Michael decided to look into her past. “I found out she had worked for Macy’s for about 40 years before retiring, getting dementia and losing contact with all her friends. I made one phone call and suddenly we went from zero to eighty people at her services. All these people were so happy I called them. So happy to see her on her way.”  <br><br>Michael says that he speaks for the dead. “I’m the representative for the dead person, trying to give them what I know they would have wanted. When I get up in heaven everyone will be like hey I know you, you’re how I got here! And I’ll ask them how I did and hopefully I did right by them. That’s all I can ask for.”<br><br>One family saw him on the street and handed him five CDs that they wanted to be placed in their uncle’s casket. “So the day after we bury him I’m cleaning my house and what do you know I find a pile of CDs. I forgot! I ran to the cemetery and asked one of the gravediggers to help me out. I put the CDs right in their uncle’s casket like they wanted, like he would have wanted.”<br><br>At first I couldn’t understand how someone as upbeat as Michael could wear all black and close caskets. Now I can’t picture him in any other color, doing anything else. “It was in 1982, I was a sophomore at St. John’s prep and my aunt passed away.” His father had told him to not leave his side but on a supposed bathroom break Michael found the funeral director and asked him all the questions he could think of. “When I got back to my seat I turned to my Dad and I says this is what I’m gonna do. I sorta felt like I had a calling for it and it was just all I wanted to do.” <br><br> <br><br>What do people say when he tells them he’s a funeral director? “Oh god. They’re like hey I gotta ask you something about my funeral. Sometimes I just say I’m a cop when I don’t feel answering all the questions.” He laughs. “One time my date even recognized me from their grandmother’s funeral. I was like uh, gotta go!”<br><br>One Christmas everyone at the funeral home got Michael a wedding band. “I was like what is this? And they told me we’re tired of breaking the news to these people! Sometimes…you don’t see what’s happening and people take a liking to ya. I guess they want me to comfort them more and I’m flattered! But no, not gonna happen.” He even had a secret admirer who sent him gifts for two years. After work he found a box of his favorite flowers, tulips, on his doorstep. They were accompanied with a note that read: Because you love tulips. “Now that was scary.” <br><br>Michael has made mistakes though. “My very first funeral, I fell into the grave.”  Another time his cufflink got stuck to another man’s while he was trying to remove a rose petal from his shirt, during his wake. “I pull my hand back and his hand came with me and everyone starts freaking out. Oh my god he’s alive! I was like oh no. No he’s not.”<br><br>Nothing though has been able to get Michael to leave the funeral business. Actually “It’s hard to go away.” Why? “Because people pass away all the time and I just want to be there for them. One time I was packed up and ready to go to Florida and Margie calls me telling me her husband Johnny just died. So I rearranged everything and did his funeral. I had to! I can’t pass him to someone else, I know too much about him.” Another time while on vacation in Greece, Michael got a call and went to a friend’s family’s funeral, in shorts and sandals. Everyone loves Michael, even when they’re not sending him tulips.<br><br>“I believe you have to live life to the fullest, have no regrets and be nice to everyone. It’s gonna come one of these days and you have to be ready. If I die today am I ready? Kinda, sorta. There are a couple things left on my bucket list but I have a healthier outlook on things. You can’t hold grudges because you never know when that day is going to come and it’s gonna’ be hard for the other person. Last thing you want is to die and people be like oh that bastard? Screw him!”<br><br>It’s 11:30 on a Friday night and I’m sitting in a Starbucks talking about death. Don’t worry. I’m fine. I’m laughing, actually.`,
  'Realizing I\'m Already There': `On a cold day in December, I’m yelling at my little sister. The blonde strands from her high blonde ponytail are tangled in her clumpy mascara eyelashes. She’s shivering and stubborn, leaning against a mural of a pink monster, in my multi colored faux fur jacket. “Do something interesting, PLEASE.” I’m begging her, tugging at my camera strap, kicking my feet together. So, so frustrated.</br></br>I see my Dad step out of our parked silver mini van. “They are going to come out great, come on.”  His reassurance is for my fashion photography project. His confidence comes from my chosen backdrop, the murals of Welling Court Astoria which are commissioned for street artists.</br></br>I force a smile and flip through the photos I’ve taken. My sister groans and throws herself onto the sidewalk. “I don’t know what you want.” I feel bad because she’s right. Nothing she does will be as interesting as the paintings I’m asking her to stand in front of. I think it was then I realized I couldn’t be a fashion photographer. </br></br>This was a couple minutes before I met Alice.</br></br>I was wearing a large white faux fur jacket. She was in plaid pajamas.</br></br>Alice is looking at my Dad. Thick rimmed glasses and a hoodie. I hear her ask what mural he likes best. With his hands in the pockets of his worn brown leather jacket he pushes his chin towards the wall in front of him. This one. She laughs. Good because that one is hers. My Dad smiles and turns to face me. Come quick. I see it in his eyes but I am already there next to him, next to Alice.</br></br><div class="Essay-line" >***</div></br></br>The second time I meet Alice I have to go through her ponytailed assistant named Yan. He opens a metal grafitted door to a warehouse in Long Island City, Queens. As we walk up the steps to Alice’s studio I ask what he does. “I don’t consider myself a street artist but I help.” He giggles. </br></br>Alice’s studio is small but her art is everywhere. My eyes are drawn to two painted figures against a gold canvas, trapped inside a long gold case. It reminds me of the first time I bought spray paint.</br></br>It was gold and behind bars. At first, I didn’t even know if they’d have it. But I wanted it. When I walked in, the art store employee looked me up and down when I asked where it was. I liked that look. That look where someone thinks they know you from what you say. I knew what she was thinking and she was wrong but I just stood there, nodding, pretending. You’re right. I want that. “It’s down that aisle,” she said. I followed. It wasn’t a big deal but I couldn’t help feeling like it was h-u-g-e­.  </br></br>Alice Mizrachi probably never had this experience. Because she is cooler than me and that Blick Art Store employee would have been right about her. Alice caught her first tag when she was thirteen.  It’s long gone in the woods somewhere now, but it was there. She thought “Ya I’m gonna be bad” and she was. She caught a tag like her brother and his friends, while balancing her small feet on metal railroad tracks with her friend Gabby. There were walls with graffiti by the tracks. I tripped over my shoelace walking down the aisle in the art store, buying gold spray paint for a Halloween costume. I’m twenty-two. She was thirteen. She walked on railroad tracks.  </br></br>Alice didn’t know what hip-hop was she “was just in it at age eight.” Her older brother was a “total b-boy” wearing Adidas suits and Adidas shoes to match. Her older sister was a “funk soul disco queen.” When her parents were traveling, her siblings were raising her and she grew up singing rapper’s delight and watching her brother’s friends break dance on cardboard in their drive way in Douglaston, Queens. It was quiet there but they weren’t. Alice talks about hanging out with graffiti writers when she was seventeen, walking along those railroad tracks with a boombox on her shoulder and catching more tags. Every Sunday she’d head to Bushwick and practice with her spray can. At first it was all “just some fun.” </br></br> Alice’s “AHA! moment” came on her way home from high school one day. She saw images of people in cracks on the sidewalk and she knew that was it. “I thought, this is what I’m here to do.”</br></br>Alice wants to make art that speaks to people the way those images in cracked cement spoke to her. She spends a lot of her time in the place where she plans on putting up her next piece.  She just wants to see who lives there and who walks by. She talks to them, asks what’s up. “I just wanna know what’s going on. I want to make a mural that is necessary for their needs.” Then she paints.</br></br>Alice lives next door to her mural in Welling Court. She lives alongside a twelve by thirty foot goddess with long flowing blue hair that spills onto the sidewalk. Isis stands tall in a rainbow of intricate crocheted mandelas. Her brown eyes watch all those who pass.</br></br>Alice wanted Isis to look over the workaholic women who walk up and down that block everyday, coming back from work exhausted but still ready to carry groceries to make dinner for their family. “They are powerhouses. God bless them, man. I want those women to know how strong and beautiful they are. So I painted Isis. She represents every women on that block whether it’s Louie’s wife or the women who just had a baby. She represents them all.” </br></br>I remember standing in front of her mural as she explained how important art in public spaces is to her. Now sitting in front of me in a purple hoodie and a long paint splattered green coat, she says much of the same. Her parents came from a war torn Israel where art was a luxury. When she told them she wanted to become an artist they didn’t understand, “Come on we’re not rich, you don’t have the luxury of being an artist” is what they said. She was terrified when she had to tell them she was going to Parsons.</br></br> You wouldn’t find her parents hanging around museums or art galleries, they didn’t feel accepted there. “Art was too big and too scary for them. So I always felt that way. To me it was more about the community in art. Art is what you see when you drive by it or see it on your way back from the market. The streets were always where I felt more comfortable.”   </br></br>Not all streets are meant for Alice’s art though. Some landowners want to use her art to raise rents. She’s not okay with that. “My art can’t be a vehicle for that. My art can’t contribute to gentrification that pushes the residents out.” So she watches, asks questions and doesn’t pick up a paintbrush and a spray can until she is completely sure her art will do exactly what it’s meant to do.</br></br>She recently flew out to Miami to paint a mural in a wine bar. “I always ask what they’re selling. If they said cigarettes I’d say no. If they say wine I’ll say yes. I love wine, I drink wine, wine is healthy.” Next week she’s heading out for a month long art residency in downtown Providence. Tonight, the two gold canvas with white and blue faces made of intricate patterns and shapes next to her are going to a gallery opening in Greenpoint. She sits in front of a white board with long red writing to do lists. I’d worry that she’s overwhelmed if it didn’t all sound so exciting.</br></br>I find myself asking her more and more questions about how she ended up here. With paint splattered shoulders and a studio. How she ended up with friends named Space, Trap and Cern; using phrases like “dope”, “mad cool” and “he’s been around for a minute.” How at 35 she makes me feel older at 22.</br></br>She asks me about what I’m studying and what I want to do after I graduate. It bothers me that I don’t have an answer for the second part. I shrug. I debate on telling her I’ve been having trouble enthusiastically applying for jobs because not many appeal to me. Finally, I tell her I love to write and make art.</br></br>She nods because she understands. As she shifts in her seat I see some of her long black curly hair peek out from underneath her grey striped beanie.  “Why work for someone else to help build their dreams when you can just build your own?” I go home and tell my parents that this is how I feel. How Alice feels. My Dad smiles. “That sounds great,” he says.</br></br>I made a website for my art, photography and design later that night.</br></br><div class="Essay-line" >***</div></br></br>As I sit in my room at midnight, mid panic, writing a paper due the next day I get a text from my Mom.</br></br>And another.</br></br>And another.</br></br>She sends me at least twenty photos from an art gallery my Dad dragged her to. Apparently she’s having more fun than she thought. I realize she’s sent me one photo three times. That’s because it’s her favorite.</br></br>A couple days later my Dad sends me a photo. A black and white image of a women who looks like a burlesque dancer, beads and lace across her face and shoulders. She stands in front of blue, purple and black flowers and leaves. The words Wild Dreamer alongside her in red. I’ve seen this already. Three times.</br></br>No, no he tells me. This is the actual piece. The artist heard my mom loved it so much she sent her a print. Just like that. For nothing. </br></br>Over the phone my Dad wants to tell me everything but I already know her name is Astrodub.</br></br><div class="Essay-line" >***</div></br></br>The second time I see Astrodub’s Wild Dreamer piece I am her lookout as she puts it on an abandoned building in Williamsburg. As she finishes applying paste I see a cop car begin it’s way down the street. We quicken the pace and turn the corner. “Aaah that was SO close dude!” It’s as if nothing happened and she begins to point out more art on the peeling yellow paint of the building. I see them a second time, moving slowly as they pass us while we look up. </br></br>When I ask Astrodub what kind of street artist she is she laughs. “I don’t consider myself a street artist. I’m an artist who puts my stuff up on the streets.” During work hours she’s a graphic designer. Whenever she gets a spare moment she’s making things with her hands. She’s Greek and I can hear it in her accent. Growing up on a small island there wasn’t much to do besides craft, so she loves to embroider and put it in her pieces.  “Working with hands and paper is my favorite thing.” If she can’t find the right paper to collage into her piece, it just won’t work.</br></br>When she does it’s amazing. “I have two pieces that worked out perfectly out of nowhere.” She prices her pieces depending on how much she is willing to part with them. All of her favorites are still hanging on her wall with big price tags so she can keep them there. They’re mostly of femme fatales because she finds them inspiring, “it’s meant to be empowering for Woman.”</br></br>When she was in High School she wrote song lyrics by Pink Floyd along brick buildings. “I love music.” Her glossy pink lips grin. She’s been DJing since she was 13 and Astrodub was her name. Astro comes from the greek work for star, dub comes from dub roots reggae, which is her favorite kind of music.</br></br>She loves lyrics but she loves words in general. If you walk around the city you may see her name beneath a quote from the movie True Romance: “You’ve got me in a vendetta kind of mood.” There are words in every one of her pieces too. Everyone can interpret them however they want but she has a vision. “In case the message isn’t clear the piece has to say something!”</br></br>While extensively photographing street art later in life she realized “that there was so much good stuff and so much crap. So I figured if there is this much crap I can put my stuff up there. ” Her street art instagram was so popular tourists would message her to show them around when they visited. They would become her lookouts while she showed them the city. Sometimes her nine year old helps her out.</br></br>Astrodub takes me on a tour through Williamsburg and tells me how this is her favorite part. She spends days looking for the perfect door. She loves rust and the color red. Abandoned buildings and peeling paint. “Placement is everything.”</br></br>That night I walked around my neighborhood in Queens and looked at every door, at every inch of peeling paint.</br></br><div class="Essay-line" >***</div></br></br>When my grandfather died I was worried my Dad would never be the same. When he cried into my shoulder I didn’t know what to do. Pat his back? Give him a hug? Say it’s all going to be fine? Nothing seemed right.</br></br>I went back home a week after the funeral to work on a photography project. While I was laying on our black couch, editing photos, I heard his hurried footsteps. I saw a white book in his hands.</br></br>“You won’t believe this. The most incredible thing happened. Now this. THIS GUY is amazing.” He hands me the book titled Outdoor Gallery and when I try to ask him why he just points to words on a page: When she died she left a hole in me the size of the universe.</br></br>My Dad points to them as if saying I FEEL THAT WAY, he doesn’t but puts the book in my hands and leaves the room without saying a word. He might as well have yelled it though because out of the corner of my eye I see him crying in the kitchen.</br></br>I continue reading the page: I went out one night and pasted prints of her on the path I took from my apartment to my job so I could see her when I walked to and from work each day…I get to walk down the street and say Hey Nan, when I walk by her.</br></br>I realize I am reading the profile of the street artist OCMC in a book featuring many of New York City’s greatest. My Dad went to the book signing last week. I see a signature in black sharpie at the bottom of the page. As I flip to the next I find a folded up email exchange between my Dad and him. The subject line is “You Are Inspiring.”</br></br>My Dad writes about his recent interest in graffiti. His new instagram dedicated to street art. One of the last memories he made with my grandfather on a ride to Welling Court to show him all the beautiful artwork. He writes about the void. The art is finding it’s way into it.</br></br>He walks into the room, brown slippers against a patterned rug. I can tell he wants to show me the email but I am already reading it, already on paragraph six of OCMC’s response.</br></br><div class="Essay-line" >***</div></br></br>The first time I met OCMC in person I am nervously scribbling on a paper tablecloth with crayons. He is running late and I still don’t know what I’m going to ask him. On the train ride over I had skimmed through my instagram and realized I’ve photographed his work. Twice. Old portraits over colorful paint strokes on elevated street lamps and grafittied doors. Soon he’d actually be in front of me. The man who put those up. The one who wrote my dad that email.</br></br>When he enters the back of Walker’s Tribeca he is wearing a green t-shirt and a scarf tied in a knot around his neck. A huge yellow sketchpad is tucked underneath his arm. He sees me, taps the waiter on the back and says “Yeah over there. I’ll let you know if she’s toooo much trouble. Thanks.” He orders a small yogurt and granola. Right before the waiter leaves he asks for a regular coke and whispers “to offset the healthiness.”</br></br>His cell phone sits next to his left hand. The case it’s in is of his grandma, the reason we’re sitting here in a crowded wooden restaurant with swirls of crayon color between us. The silk screen of his grandmother was one of the first paintings he did, what most people on the street know as him.</br></br>“Doing this is really fun for me because once somebody dies you can’t really do anything else for them.” He holds the iphone up to his face. “When that book came out it’s unbelievable that I can walk into MOMA and there is a book with my grandma’s picture in it.”  Pausing, he takes a deep breath and smiles “That is just mind blowing to me.”</br></br>People always thought he was going to be an artist until he picked up a guitar and “cared about nothing else.” OCMC originally came to New York City to make an album with his band. They were called Sons of Bitches. He throws his head back and laughs when he belts out the name. After watching Dead Poet’s Society the line “Oh Captain My Captain” from Walt Whitman’s poem stuck with him. He thought it’d be the next name of his band but that never happened. Instead it became his street art name. I didn’t learn his name was John until halfway through lunch.</br></br> He has, what he calls a “weird habit” of getting into things later on in life. Skateboarding is something he picked up when he was 35 after watching a special on kids skating in empty pools. The next day he bought a skateboard. “I just thought…I want to do that.” And so he did.</br></br>It was on a kick turn when it happened. OCMC fell eight feet and even with a helmet he ended up with a pocket of liquid in the front of his head. Doctors told him he couldn’t skateboard or fall for eight months. If he did, they had no idea what would happen to his memory. He still has trouble remembering names.</br></br>No skateboarding meant walking around in art galleries and admiring Andy Warhol. When he looked at his silkscreens OCMC thought I want to do that. Eventually he found a weekend class and ended up in a room with one of Andy Warhol’s silk screeners. “I want to do that” is how he gets into most things.</br></br> When it came time to make his own work OCMC recalls a memory he can’t shake. He lives in Tribeca where the twin towers once stood. He was a block away when the planes came. The fire blast felt like pyro from a metal show. He looked up when he realized it wasn’t.</br></br>In 2001 while walking through the neighborhood he saw images of people who lost their lives during 9/11 pasted up on a wall with the words Remember Me written over them. It got to him. He cried right then and there.</br></br>His grandmother passed away a year later. He was left with this hole.</br></br>So he painted some colorful strokes and silk-screened an old portrait of his grandmother on top. “I tend to like old portraits. Not necessarily because they’re young but because no one goes and gets their portraits taken anymore and it was a big deal back then.” I look at his phone. With thin eyebrows sitting over eyes staring off into the distance, his grandmother looks as if she has better things to look at then me. Her heart shaped lips make me wonder what she sounded like. She was beautiful with short curly hair parted to the side. “People always ask me…what actress is that?”</br></br>  Twenty-five of his closest friends soon after received an email in their inbox.</br></br>“Everyone has someone that they’ve lost and I’d put them up in the city and be like oh go on Crosby or go around this area and maybe you’ll find them…and then they could see them again. That’s the best part about this whole thing.” To his surprise, not a single person responded. </br></br>Years later one of his friend would tell him “I had no idea what the hell you were talking about.”</br></br>His inbox was filled with fan letters instead. The first came from a famous graffiti artists from the NYC subway GRAFF era, Futura. Apparently he didn’t like seeing OCMC’s art all scratched up. So he repaired them on Photoshop and emailed them back to him. Another artist Fab Five Freddy couldn’t believe no one wrote him back. “He was like dude I love that idea! You see so many celebrities out there and I love how it’s someone that’s actually important to someone else.” OCMC received an email from him later that day with a portrait of Freddy’s father. Do what you want with him.</br></br>Futura and Fab Five had a studio together in Williamsburg. Across the street was a huge blank wall. “That was perfect. I thought that is what I’ll do with him.”</br></br>That was the first time he almost got caught by the cops. Grabbing the crayons in between us he draws the street. Williamsburg. 10 PM. Sunday. He’s applying glue to the wall when the cop rolls down the block. When the cop takes his driver’s license he says to him “You know…you’re old enough to know better.” OCMC told him “I’m not so sure I am.”</br></br>The second time he almost got caught he was with another street artist. The police thought they were breaking into someone’s house. “I feel bad when I see people walk the other way when they see me on the street at night. It’s funny…I’m like you think I’m going to harm you but all I wanna do is put up this poster of my grandmother so if you could just skedaddle that’d be great.”</br></br> </br></br>I remember trying to graffiti my Dad’s garage for Christmas. I had so much left over gold in that spray can bottle.</br></br>Every year someone tags it with sloppy lettering. No figures. No words. No art. Just gray smudges over dull brown paint. And then, another layer of dull brown paint and my Dad’s heavy sign. With his new found passion for graffiti I couldn’t think of a better thing to do for him then to put up what he loves most.</br></br>I was sitting in front of our garage one night when I thought about what it would look like if someone saw me. I was worried about our neighbor’s extensive security system. The lady down the street’s dog. Someone calling the cops, even though it was my house. But how would they know? Eventually I zipped up my coat and covered my spray can. I didn’t have much of a plan. It wouldn’t have come out that good anyway. I couldn’t think of what would be good enough to put up. I let myself back in.</br></br> OCMC mentions how much he loves collage. So do I. Should I show him mine? I’d only shown a handful of people, and most of them had been related to me. Eventually I pull one up on my phone. “Wait…these are seriously good.” He flips through them. “These are better than most of the shit I see out there!” Then he tells me about Mr. B, a kid who puts up images of cleavage and butts in little boxes. According to OCMC, he’s everywhere. “It’s like Jesus if you’re gonna be out there more than anyone else do something really good. I started noticing if I put something up he would put it up right next to me. And not for nothing but I don’t want to see some prostitute’s ass next to my grandmother.”</br></br>“Anyway.” He still has my phone in his hands and tells me I should try to put them on the streets. “I guarantee you someone will notice. You could end up with a show in less than a year, just watch.” As he shows me around Tribeca he keeps pointing out doors, abandoned buildings, grafittied walls, rooftops. “Now hypothetically…if you had some paste and some of those collages, that might be a cool place to put them. I mean hypothetically of course.”</br></br>That night I went to the Kinko’s near my house and made three large twenty by sixteen inch prints of a collage of mine.</br></br><div class="Essay-line" >***</div></br></br>When I’m in front of my spot I hear all of them in my head.</br></br>Picking my collage out of the copy store envelope I wonder what types of conversations it’ll have with people who see it. I wonder if this is part of the dream Alice was talking about, if she knows now it’s part of mine.</br></br>As I take a look down the bridge I see what’s in front of me. A white brick wall next to long growing ivy, right along Walnut. I wonder if Astro Dub would have been drawn to it, if she knows I double take at every empty space.</br></br>As I start applying paste I think of OCMC telling me he only puts things up in broad daylight if he’s wearing a suit because no one will see it coming. On this sunny day in April I’m wearing a long flower dress. I wonder if he knows his “hypothetically” was the most encouraging thing I’ve heard in a while.</br></br>As I walk away I can’t stop smiling. I wonder what people will say. And who will see it. I wonder if they’ll get it, find meaning in it or think it’s trash. I wonder if someone will take it down. But as I cross the street with two more prints in my backpack I realize I don’t care. I realize I am already there.`
